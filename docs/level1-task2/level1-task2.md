# MAD Level 1 - Task 2

## Overview

### Truth table app

We need to make an app in which the knowledge of the user for the truth table of conjunction is tested. It should be a 
quiz in which the user is only allowed to fill in `“T”` or `“F”` (true or false). When all input fields are filled in, the user 
should click on the submit button to see how many answers are correct. This should be done with a Toast message. 
The user can try again until all the answers are right. The layout file should be built with a `ConstraintLayout`.

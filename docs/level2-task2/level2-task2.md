# MAD Level 2 - Task 2

## Overview

### Swipe quiz app

Create a quiz where a user can swipe the question to the left if he thinks the statement is incorrect or swipe 
the question to the right if he thinks the statement is correct. 
When a user swipes a question, and the answer is correct then the question is removed from the list. 
Otherwise, the app should give feedback via a Snackbar message that the question will not be removed from the list.

The result should look like the gif on the left. Add some questions to your app to test the app.  

//TODO add gif

### You're on your own!

Task 2 of each level doesn't provide you a solution nor step by step guidance. 
When you are done, push to Github! ðŸ’¥

Positive
: **Optional** If a user clicks on an item you will get a sneak preview about whether the questions are good or false. See this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/wKFJsrdiGS8) on how to fix this.
